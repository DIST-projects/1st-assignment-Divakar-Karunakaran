A peer-to-peer file sharing setup was implemented using the BitTorrent protocol with two peers. An AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu acted as the seeding peer, where a file was created and a .torrent file was generated and seeded using a command-line torrent client. A local PC acted as the downloading peer using a graphical torrent client. The local peer connected directly to the cloud peer and downloaded the file through peer-to-peer communication. File integrity was automatically verified using hash checking after the download completed, demonstrating decentralized file sharing without relying on a central server.
